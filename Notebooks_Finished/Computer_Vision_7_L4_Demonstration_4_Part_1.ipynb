This means its parameters will be updated during training. In essence, we're using the `features` portion to feed our `classifier` portion a base representation of an image and then our `classifier` layer is going to learn how to base representation aligns with our problem.\n",
        "* **Less trainable parameters** - Previously there was 5,288,548 trainable parameters. But since we froze many of the layers of the model and only left the `classifier` as trainable, there's now only 3,843 trainable parameters (even less than our TinyVGG model). Though there's also 4,007,548 non-trainable parameters, these will create a base representation of our input images to feed into our `classifier` layer.\n",

Freezing the base layers of our model and leaving it with less trainable parameters means our model should train quite quickly. This is one huge benefit of transfer learning, taking the already learned parameters of a model trained on a problem similar to yours and only tweaking the outputs slightly to suit your problem."
