    "\n",
    "In ordinal encoding, each unique category value is assigned an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, “red” is 1, “green” is 2, and “blue” is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called an ordinal encoding or an integer encoding and is easily reversible. Often, integer values starting at zero are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some variables, an ordinal encoding may be enough. The integer values have a natural ordered relationship between each other and machine learning algorithms may be able to understand and harness this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a natural encoding for ordinal variables. For categorical variables, it imposes an ordinal relationship where no such relationship may exist. This can cause problems and a one-hot encoding may be used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ordinal encoding transform is available in the scikit-learn Python machine learning library via the OrdinalEncoder class.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, it will assign integers to labels in the order that is observed in the data. If a specific order is desired, it can be specified via the “categories” argument as a list with the rank order of all expected labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can demonstrate the usage of this class by converting colors categories “red”, “green” and “blue” into integers. First the categories are sorted then numbers are applied. For strings, this means the labels are sorted alphabetically and that blue=0, green=1 and red=2.\n",
