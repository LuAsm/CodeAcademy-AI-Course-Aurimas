<b> Overview </b> <br>
</p>
Artificial intelligence involves the development of systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. 
These systems can now mimic routine, non-creative behaviors and automate certain processes. Knowledge of artificial intelligence,
which is called the technology of the future, gives a specialist a huge advantage. Artificial intelligence technology with a long 
enough history is still constantly growing and changing. There are great opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence â€“ 
after all, it can expand human possibilities in a way that is still difficult to imagine today.
